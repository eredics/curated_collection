## MODULE 03: FILTER PANEL DESIGN (INSTRUCTION-BASED)

- Add a collapsible filter panel above the gallery

Design Notes:
- The panel should be hidden on initial load
- Use a “Toggle Filters” button to expand/collapse it
- Match the look and feel of the gallery with consistent styling

Add to index.html and styles.css as appropriate
