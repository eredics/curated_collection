## MODULE 02: CSV LOADING FUNCTIONALITY (INSTRUCTION-BASED)

- Use Papa Parse to:
  - Load the artwork CSV file
  - Parse it into usable JavaScript objects
  - Automatically skip empty lines
  - Use headers from the first row

- If there are parsing errors:
  - Log a detailed error to the console
  - Gracefully reject the Promise or stop rendering

- Store successful results in dataModel.js for downstream use
