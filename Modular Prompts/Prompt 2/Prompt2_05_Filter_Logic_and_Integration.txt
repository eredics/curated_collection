## MODULE 05: FILTER LOGIC AND INTEGRATION (INSTRUCTION-BASED)

- Implement JavaScript filtering logic triggered by UI changes

Behavior:
- When a filter value changes, re-evaluate the dataset
- Filter the full artwork dataset (from dataModel.js)
- Display only the artwork cards that match all selected filters

Implementation tips:
- Use event listeners on filter controls
- Keep filtering fast (consider debouncing)
- Keep the original dataset unmodified
