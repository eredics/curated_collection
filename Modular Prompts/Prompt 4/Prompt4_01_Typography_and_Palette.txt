## MODULE 01: TYPOGRAPHY AND COLOR PALETTE (INSTRUCTION-BASED)

- Refine the siteâ€™s typography:

  - Use a clean sans-serif for UI and elegant serif for headings
  - Establish hierarchy with size, weight, and spacing

- Use a subtle neutral background and accent colors

  - Ensure good contrast for accessibility
  - Integrate a muted highlight color (ex: button hovers)

- Apply these styles consistently across captions, filters, and headers
