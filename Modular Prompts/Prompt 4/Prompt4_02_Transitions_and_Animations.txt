## MODULE 02: TRANSITIONS AND ANIMATIONS (INSTRUCTION-BASED)

- Add CSS transitions for:

  - Smooth image loading (fade-in)
  - Filter panel toggle
  - Caption toggle reveal
  - Gallery grid transitions (filtering/searching)

- Avoid harsh changes; prefer soft fades, transforms, and subtle movement

- All animations should be non-blocking and performance friendly
