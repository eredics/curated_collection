## MODULE 10: HTML GALLERY STRUCTURE (INSTRUCTION-BASED)

- Use a clean and consistent HTML structure for each artwork item

Each artwork should include:
- An image container with the artwork image wrapped in a link
- A hidden caption section containing Title, Artist, Price, and Size
- A toggle button to show/hide the caption

- Use consistent class names for easy styling and scripting
