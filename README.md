# 🖼️ Curated Collection

An AI-curated, modular virtual gallery built with Claude Sonnet (via GitHub Copilot Chat) using a step-by-step prompt system.

Designed to be fully offline, accessible, and responsive, this gallery loads artwork from a local CSV and displays it using a flexbox-based layout.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling Gallery**: Load thousands of images efficiently
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Filtering System**: Filter by artist, technique, and price
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as they enter viewport
- **Fast Initial Load**: First batch displays immediately

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eredics/curated_collection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd curated_collection

3. Serve with any static server:
python -m http.server 8000

4. Open in your browser:
http://localhost:8000


## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Curated Collection uses a modular architecture combining several modern web development patterns:

### MVC Pattern
- **Model**: Handles data management, CSV parsing, and state
- **View**: Renders UI components and manages DOM interactions
- **Controller**: Coordinates between Model and View, handles application logic

### Component System
The UI is built using a lightweight component system that provides:
- Template-based rendering
- Data binding
- Event delegation
- Lifecycle hooks (beforeRender, afterRender, onDestroy)

### Offline-First Approach
- Service Worker for asset caching
- Local storage with fallbacks
- Robust error handling and recovery

## 📦 Prompt Module System

This project is built from 5 Claude prompt stacks, each broken into modular instructions:

| Prompt | Scope                              | Modules                    |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1      | Core structure + gallery rendering | Layout, splash, images     |
| 2      | CSV loading + basic filtering      | Data pipeline, filter UI   |
| 3      | Advanced filtering + search        | AND filters, live search   |
| 4      | UI design + animation              | Typography, transitions    |
| 5      | Frame visualization + export       | Modal preview, download    |

Use Claude Sonnet + GitHub Copilot Chat to implement each module.

## 🤖 Working With Claude Sonnet (Copilot Chat)

Paste one module at a time and say:

> “Claude, please implement this module. Generate HTML, CSS, and JS. Include inline comments.”

Ask follow-ups like:
- “Use mobile-first styles”
- “Make the modal keyboard accessible”
- “Refactor this to use canvas layers”

---

## Development

### Code Quality

This project uses linting tools to maintain code quality and consistency:

- **JavaScript**: ESLint with custom configuration
- **CSS**: Stylelint with standard configuration
- **HTML**: HTMLHint

#### Linting Commands

```bash
# Lint all files
npm run lint

# Lint and automatically fix issues where possible
npm run lint:fix

# Lint specific file types
npm run lint:js
npm run lint:css
npm run lint:html
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Service worker registers for offline support
   - Application loads configuration from constants.js
   - Controller initializes Model and View

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Model loads artwork data from CSV
   - Failsafe system handles potential data corruption
   - Data is processed and normalized

3. **Rendering**:
   - View creates components based on data from Model
   - Template engine processes component templates
   - Components are rendered to the DOM
   - Event listeners are attached

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Events are captured by the component system
   - Controller processes user actions
   - Model updates based on controller instructions
   - View re-renders as needed

## 🔌 Module Relationships

- **Component System**: Core UI rendering engine that other modules use
- **Template Engine**: Used by Component for HTML string processing
- **Router**: Manages application state and navigation
- **Failsafe**: Provides error recovery across all modules
- **Utils**: Shared utility functions used throughout the application

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application implements a mobile-first approach with:
- Fluid grid layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Viewport-based measurements with iOS fixes
- Touch-optimized controls
- Media queries for different device sizes

## 🔒 Offline Capabilities

- Service worker caches all essential assets
- IndexedDB/localStorage for user data persistence
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Sync capabilities when connection is restored

## 🧩 Extensions and Customization

The modular architecture allows for easy extension:
- Add new components by extending the Component class
- Register new routes in the Router
- Add data processors to handle different data sources

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images don't load offline**
   - Ensure the service worker has registered correctly
   - Check browser's cache storage to confirm assets are cached

2. **Performance issues on mobile**
   - Try enabling the "Reduce Motion" option
   - Disable high-resolution images in the settings

3. **Data not saving between sessions**
   - Check if your browser has cookies/storage disabled
   - Ensure your device has available storage space

## Assumptions
Fixed Dimensions: We assumed that fixed artwork dimensions (220px × 240px) provide the most reliable layout
Flexbox Superiority: We determined flexbox works better than CSS grid for this specific gallery layout
Direct DOM Manipulation: We assumed direct DOM creation is more efficient than templating for this use case
Batch Loading: We assumed loading 20-40 items at a time provides the optimal balance between performance and UX
Style Overriding: We assumed using !important was necessary to overcome conflicting styles
Single Data Source: We assumed all artwork data comes from one CSV file with a consistent format
Modern Browser Features: We assumed support for modern JS/CSS features like flexbox and IntersectionObserver
Image Availability: We assumed all image paths in the CSV data point to valid, accessible image files



xImage Naming Pattern
Based on your description:

Image files in images_scraped folder start with a 5-digit number (00001 to 10443)
This number corresponds to the "Sort" column in filtered.csv
The filename number ends at the first underscore
